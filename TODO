- Practice Making NanoGUI windows and widgets
- Learn OpenCL
	- make basic kernel
	- pass between OpenGL and OpenCL
- organize program
- Calculate fps
- Use opengl math library
- Prepare Camera, perspective matrix etc... (in opengl math lib?)



- Initialize array of particles on GPU with openCL
- Retrieve pointer
- Pass pointer to OpenGL
- Render particle
- Affect particle with openCL kernel and force
- Pass pointer back to OpenGL and render


glMapBuffer to map pointer and be able to access and modify values in the GPU from the CPU

To execute openCL kernel:
	clEnqueueAcquireGLObjects
	clEnqueueNDRangeKernel
	clEnqueueReleaseGLObjects

- init list of particles
